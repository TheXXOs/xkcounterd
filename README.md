# xkcounterd
I am a massive [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/ "xkcd by Randall Munroe") fan, so I have decided to try to count the number of times I reference it in 2021.

It's technically my New Year's Resolution for 2021, I guess?

## How am I going to do that?
I have a bit of a plan (but it's not a full one yet); I'm going to:
 - Create a python file that allows me to quickly add references from the day
 - Save the references in a JSON file
 - Display it at [https://thexxos.github.io/xkcounterd/](https://thexxos.github.io/xkcounterd/ "My website: xkcounterd")

## Why am I doing this?
I should ask myself that, honestly.

It's because:

 **a)** I am an xkcd fan and reference it a lot.

 **b)** I want to learn Javascript (and more Python) so this is my way of forcing myself to do it.

 **c)** I can use this as my New Year's Resolution for 2021 if I want.
