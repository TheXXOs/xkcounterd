# xkcounterd
I am a massive [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/ "xkcd by Randall Munroe") fan, so I have decided to try to count the number of times I reference it in 2021.

## How am I going to do that?
I have a bit of a plan (but it's not a full one yet); I'm going to:
 - Create a python file that allows me to quickly add references from the day
 - Save the references in a JSON file
 - Display it at [https://thexxos.github.io/xkcounterd/](https://thexxos.github.io/xkcounterd/ "My website: xkcounterd")

## Credits
The 7-segment display font I'm going to use [DSEG7](https://github.com/keshikan/DSEG "keshikan/DSEG on Github") by [keshikan](https://github.com/keshikan "keshikan on Github")
The JavaScript plugin that I will use for graphs is [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/ "Official Chart.js website")
